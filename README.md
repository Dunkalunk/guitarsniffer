## Phase Shift Setup

Since Clone Hero hasn't released anything yet the only current option to play with is Phase Shift.  

### Steam Version

After setting up the drum sniffer just open the game from Steam and the controller won't be recognized.  It will then have you map all the drums.  Pro cymbals work just fine for this.

### Free Version

For four lane drums just download the controller mapper [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/dtwnzgzmwdz/PSCtrl_v1.6.zip/file).  This will help you create a new profile to add to the device_list.ini in the settings folder of the Phase Shift install

Their controller profiler doesn't work with pro cymbals as far as I can tell so you need to follow the instructions [here](https://www.dwsk.co.uk/phase_shift_readme.html#customcontrollers) to map out all the drums and cymbals.  It's not perfect.  From what I've seen so far Clone Hero will be MUCH better!
